Reward Ideas
============

$2 -- Invitation!  Upon launch, you will be automatically notified that the website is live and immediately added to the network without the need to confirm your account.

$4 -- The right to input.  When I need to make a decision about which feature I need to develop, I will invite you into a poll

$8 -- The right to input anytime.  You will receive an email address that you can send ideas, suggestions, and requests to that you think a social network focused on privacy should have!

$16 -- The right to dialogue.  Your input will always receive a constructive response consisting of at least 100 words about my reactions: including--but not limited to--enthusiasm, inspiration, and thoughts about implementation.

$32 -- The right to insight.  I will share my ideas about how Sphr can better serve friendships and privacy in a weekly newsletter!
