Current social networks have disturbing business models: collect information about users in order to better target them with advertisements.

Sphrs (pronounced "Spheres" -- the vowels are removed for a catchy domain name) is a social network motivated entirely by donations and is designed for privacy from the ground up.  With Sphrs, users can easily and intuitively assign their friends into "rings" and "cones."  Friendships in farther rings can see less about you than ones in closer rings while you can permit which cones of friends see the content of media that you share.  

I have a working set of code that is ready to deploy and I am appealing to the kickstarter community to get Sphrs online.
