There are several features to this website:
1) Unlike other social networks, a user assigns friends to "rings" of varying distance.
  The greater the ring number, the less information the user is privileged to see.
  Hence ring 1 should be reserved for close friends and family,
  while higher rings ought to be occupied by professional colleagues and acquaintances 
2) Users have greater customization over their public and private appearances over the web
  - Profiles of information can be tailored to each ring.
  - A "projection" is the first impression that a visitior has when visiting a users
  page and can be setup to highlight different things to different people.
3) Users can earn money by attracting people to their page.
  Advertisements are displayed whenever users view one another's media or content.  Users
	are then paid forward a percentage of how much money they generated depending on how many people
	visited their site.  The more people that visit, the greater the share that they generate.

Note that the development server will need the following installations:
1) Rails
2) Authlogic Gem #Should change to Devise or develop a custom authentication solution
3) mysql2
4) Formtastic
5) JQuery #NOT Prototype
