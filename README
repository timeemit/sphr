Unlike other social networks, a user assigns friends to "rings" of varying distance.
The greater the ring number, the less information the user is privileged to see.
Hence ring 1 should be reserved for close friends and family,
while higher rings ought to be occupied by professional colleagues and acquaintances.

A user can manage just exactly how much friends in different rings see
by managing the profile for each ring.  Users can also group their friends into "cones."
